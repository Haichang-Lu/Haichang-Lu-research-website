Automated Magnetism Analysis via Tensorial Interacting Spins (_AMATIS_) is a structure to magnetism tool to predict the thermal equilibrium properties of magnets, developed by Haichang Lu of Beihang University. It is written in c++ and needs to compile with the Eigen package. Currently, it can interface only with the ad initio code VASP, but we are working on it to be compatible with any package that supports total energy calculations considering spin-orbit coupling.
